# DH-Portfolio

I restarted my portfolio because I did not like my original. At the time, I was struggling with bootstrap but I think I have the hang of it now.

On my index.html, I made it an "About me/Homepage". I used a card with a photo of myself and brief description of me.

On my contact.html, I used a list from bootstrap to include email, phone, linked in, and git hub. I disabled email and phone because they do not require a link. I did link my github and linkedin to open in a new tab, though. I was proud of this.

On my portfolio, I included a screenshot in a card of one of the projects I worked on in class with a brief description.

Lastly, I created a resume page (resume needs to be updated badly, but I don't pay for the website I made it on anymore) with a button that brings you to my resume where it can be downloaded!!!
